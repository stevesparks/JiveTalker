==========

A speech synthesis app for Mac.

This app uses low-level facilities to replicate (as much as the APIs will allow) an old System 7 app 
called "Talk Back To Basics". This app would allow you to assign a string, voice, and pitch to any key,
and then use the keyboard as a speech synthesis musical instrument.

In 'Performance Mode', the keys play the samples identified on the 'Edit Mode' panel.

To test the app, run the 'auld lang syne' sample song, and then hit all the keys in the 'qwerty' row, in order.
